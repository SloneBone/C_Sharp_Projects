# C_Sharp_Projects
Projects for the Tech Academy utilizing C# and the .NET Framework. 
 
 <h1>Car Insurance</h1>
 <p>This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calulates a quote based
on bussiness logic.  There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>

<h1>21 Card Game</h2>
<p>This project is a Console application that creates a casino game of 21 between one Player and the Dealer. Some of the logic involved includes: creating a deck, dealing a deck, shuffling a deck, assigning face values, detecting value of Ace(in BlackJack an Ace can either represent 1 or 11), detecting BlackJack, detecting Bust, detecting winning hand, betting, transfer of bets based on win/loss, and some exception handling. This project was a ton of fun and I look forward to adding more to this. </p>


<h1>Final_Challenge_3 </h1>
<p>This challenge was to build a database using a Code-First approach. I built a simple .Net Core Console App using the Entity Framework to create Student and Grade classes and a dbContext class to construct a dB on my local hard-drive just through the code itself! </p>

<h1>Various Assignments</h1>
<p>During my education in this course I was assigned various tasks to complete that revolved around C# fundamentals. Some of these include: Lambda Functions, 
Abstract Classes, Generics, Interfaces, Struct, SuperClass, Void, Static, Exception Handling, Operator Overloading and many others.  These assignments gave me a good understanding of the basics of C# providing me with the building blocks to implement these core ideas into my future projects.   </p>
