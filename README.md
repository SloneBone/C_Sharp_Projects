# C_Sharp_Projects
Projects for the Tech Academy utilizing C# and the .NET Framework. 
 
 <h1>Car Insurance</h1>
 <p>This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calulates a quote based
on bussiness logic.  There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>


<h1>Final_Challenge_3 </h1>
<p>This challenge was to build a database using a Code-First approach. I built a simple .Net Core Console App using the Entity Framework to create Student and Grade classes and a dbContext class to construct a dB on my local hard-drive just through the code itself! </p>
